## Initial Attacks by Russia
In January 2022, [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59992531) reported that 70 Ukrainian government websites had been breached, with messages appearing on those sites warning the Ukrainian citizens to “prepare for the worst”. This marked the beginning of a “cyber war” that has been waged on an international level. One month later, Russia formally began it’s invasion of Ukraine and stepped up attacks. Notably, various [DDOS](https://thehill.com/policy/international/594330-ukraine-defense-ministry-banks-hit-by-cyberattack-amid-tensions-with/) attacks took place against government targets in Ukraine (including banking systems), on top of [data wiping malware](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia) being installed on many key government machines.

## Global Response
The response to these attacks have come not just from Ukraine, but all over the world. Notably, the Anonymous hacktivism group announced that it’s members had begun “operations against the Russian Federation” ([see here](https://x.com/YourAnonNews/status/1496954233492541444)), and according to them, they had hacked [more than 2500 targets](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/cybersecurity/anonymous-claims-more-than-2500-targets-hacked-in-first-week-of-oprussia-offensive/) in the first week of their “#OpRussia” campaign

## Continued Offensive
The cyber war continues to this day, across many domains. Notably, between August 2023 and March 2024, [46000 civilian and military aircraft](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/22/thousands-of-flights-to-and-from-europe-affected-by-suspected-russian-jamming) have reported satellite navigation issues in airspace near Russia, which is suspected to have been caused by Russia themselves.
