## What happened
I opted to sign up for the chess.com daily world championship for a good bit of experience and a reason to keep checking in on my games and improving my chess. I was given a selection of opponents close to my rating, right up to 1800, and I managed to beat a 1400! This game was a rollercoaster, with most moves being highlighted by chess.com in some way or another.

## The game

## Exciting moves in the opening
I got to play the Giuoco Piano, which is by far the opening I know the most. *6. cxd4* isn't a line I am super familiar with, particularly as I thought I was already behind after *6.. Bb4+* but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was all still clear theory, and I successfully got to move 8, before my opponent made the first mistake with *8.. Nd6?*

This is a mistake as I can play *Bb3* followed by *Re1!* and be massively winning after 10 moves, as the opponent is forced to give up castling rights should they not want to lose a devestating amout of material. I had the right idea by playing *9. Qe2+?!* but this misses the idea a little as it doesn't bring the bishop to safety, and my advantage slipped away. 

## Exciting moves in the middlegame
But not for long!! *12.. O-O?* from the opponent allowed me to employ one of my most practiced tactics, the pin! *13. Bd5!* pins the opponent's knight to the queen, forcing it to stay still. Additionally, the best move here for the opponent is to attack the bishop with *f6*, which allows the knight to pick up a free bishop with *14. Ne7+!* (discovered check!) and I'm just winning again. The opponent threw me off with *13..Re8* instead, and I didn't spot the way to win material.

After letting the advantage slip again, I managed to reclaim a small advantage with *21. Qd5!*, picking up a pawn with check.
